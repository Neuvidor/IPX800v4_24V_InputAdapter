# Purpose ?
This rail DIN module is recommended for people who wants to use their original 230V command light (push button) on a IPX800V4, X-8R, X-Dimmer.

# How it works ?
The module has 8 channels allowing to use 24Vdc instead of 3.3Vdc from the IPX800v4.
In order to use it, it's necessary to replace on all your commmand light the 230Vac by a 24Vdc power supply.
The optocouplers will convert the 24Vdc signal comming to an IPX800V4 signal compatible.
